README: Zesty Juice Chatbot Application

Overview
This application is a customer service chatbot designed to assist online customers in purchasing juice products. It leverages the power of OpenAI's language models, LangChain for task chaining, and Flask for API creation to provide a conversational and informative experience.
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following:
 * Python (version 3.6 or later)
 * OpenAI API key (obtain one from the OpenAI platform)
 * Required libraries:
   * openai
   * langchain
   * flask
   * requests
Installation
 * Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Cedrqmwesigwa/zestychatbotbeta/

 * Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

 * Set your OpenAI API key:
   Create a .env file in the project root and add the following line, replacing <your_api_key> with your actual API key:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>

Running the Application
 * Start the Flask server:
   python app.py

 * Access the chatbot:
   Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You can interact with the chatbot by typing messages into the chat interface.
How it Works
 * User Input: The user types a message into the chat interface.
 * Message Processing: The message is sent to the LangChain pipeline, which handles task chaining and context management.
 * Model Interaction: The LangChain pipeline interacts with the OpenAI language model to generate a response.
 * Response Generation: The model's response is formatted and sent back to the user.
Customization
You can customize the chatbot's behavior by:
 * Modifying the prompt template used to guide the language model's responses.
 * Adding or removing tasks in the LangChain pipeline.
 * Customizing the Flask API to integrate with other systems or services.
Additional Notes
 * For production deployment, consider using a web framework like Django or FastAPI for more robust features and scalability.
 * Be mindful of the OpenAI API usage limits and costs.
 * Regularly update the required libraries to ensure compatibility and access to the latest features.
Support
If you encounter any issues or have questions, please feel free to open a GitHub issue or contact the project maintainers.
